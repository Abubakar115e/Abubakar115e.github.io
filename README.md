## LLM Explorer: Free LLM Testing on Google Colab

One of my recent projects is the LLM Explorer, a tool that allows you to run and test Large Language Models (LLMs) with a chat interface for free on Google Colab. This project demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies and create practical solutions for testing and experimentation.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes Google Colab's free GPU resources
- Implements a chat interface for easy interaction with LLMs
- Supports document upload for context-aware responses
- Integrates with popular LLM frameworks like Langchain

This project showcases my skills in Python programming, working with AI models, and creating user-friendly interfaces for complex systems. It's an excellent example of how I approach problem-solving and innovation in the field of AI and data science.
